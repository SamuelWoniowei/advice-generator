## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript


### What I learned

I learned how to do the glow effect using css when the advice generator button is clicked

```css
.footer-icon:active {
    box-shadow: 0px 0px 17px 8px hsl(150, 100%, 66%);
}
```

### Continued development

I intend to extend the functionality of the advice generator to include a search for advice based on an entered word.

### Useful resources

- [How to Add Glow Effects Quickly and Easily With CSS3](https://www.thoughtco.com/glow-effects-with-css3-p2-4091601) - This helped me get code snippet to add glow effect with which I modified to suit this project.
